Introduction
------------

The Caltech Library is working on applications of OCR and HTR (handwritten text recognition) to documents stored in the [Caltech Archives](https://archives.caltech.edu).  The development of software such as [Handprint](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/handprint) requires test cases in the form of images of documents.  This repository holds a collection of such images for the Library's work.


Installation
------------

There is no software in this repository; it contains only image files.  Currently, the only mechanism available for obtaining the whole set is to use `git clone`:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/caltechlibrary/handprint-test-cases.git
```
 

Usage
-----

This is a collection of image files.  The images are stored in subdirectories that give some indication of their origins and natures.


Known issues and limitations
----------------------------

None at this time.


Getting help
------------

If you find an issue, please submit it in [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/handprint/issues) for this repository.


Contributing
------------

We would be happy to receive your help and participation with enhancing Handprint!  Please visit the [guidelines for contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) for some tips on getting started.
